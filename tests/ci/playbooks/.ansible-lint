# NOTE(andreykurilin): ansible-lint expects playbooks to be in a separate
#   directory called 'playbooks'. There is no real reason for such structure
#   and it also requires specific ansible config option to be specified so
#   playbooks can find roles.
#   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/sample_setup.html#sample-directory-layout
#   Despite the fact, ansible-lint has 'kinds' configuration option for
#   specifying 'custom' structure, it doesn't support relative paths, so the
#   name of repository is hardcoded here. Not the best solution, but should
#   work as soon as nobody renames it locally :)
